    "text": "Reflecting on my R experience, it has been an uphill battle. I am not someone who has been able to understand coding, even though I love learning new languages and have been learning languages beyond my mother tongue. I think my experience has mostly been difficult as it took me many hours (and is still taking me many hours) to understand even the most basic of concepts that have been taught during lectures and to apply them to my data-story. However, I do think that this journey with R has challenged me to explore material beyond my comfort zone and learn something new that can seemingly be beneficial in the future.\nThe main thing I learnt in NM2207 was how to use data to support your story. I have always been a storyteller at heart, but finding and using data visualisations to support whatever story that I have to tell is something that NM2207 taught me. Given that I study Political Science, analysing data is important for processes such as policy-making or even advertising of policies. Hence, I can adapt this idea of data visualisation and telling a story through data using R, to my future career in this manner."

    "text": "Land Temperature and Climate Change\nOver the past century, the land surface temperature of Earth has been gradually rising. The rate at which land temperatures have been rising is concerning, ranging from the Arctic’s frozen tundra to Africa’s sun-drenched deserts. Human activity is the main cause of this temperature rise, especially the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that trap heat and cause global warming. The identified dataset on land temperatures is from an online source, Kaggle, which has repackaged the data from a newer compilation put together by the [Berkeley Earth](http://berkeleyearth.org/about/), which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives."
