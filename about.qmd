## Self-Introduction

Hi! I am Shreekari{style="color: #ccccff;"}, I am a Year 3 Political Science student, with a second major in Communications and New Media.

## My Interests

I am a <b>HUGE</b> Potterhead (as evidenced by the picture below), and I love to read. More importantly, I love to tell stories, which is why NM2207 as a course stood out to me so much! :)
